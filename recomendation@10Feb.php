        	<b style="font-size:13px;"> Why recommend deals?</b><br /> Recommending deals has many benefits but most importantly, we will credited you with 5.00 which means you can get your next deal at even greater discounted price. The main reason we like our users to recommend deals is because we feel god to know that all people who are interested in buying our deals are aware of the deal. Help your friends, families etc. to save money on great deals too!

        	<b style="font-size:13px;"> How can I recommend GeeLaza to my friends who havent heard of GeeLaza?</b><br /> We provide our users with easy recommendation facilities to allow them to tell friends without doing much. Every deal that we feature on GeeLaza are assigned with a special link which you can send to your friends using Facebook, Twitter or Email.<br /><br /> Whoever you recommend us to, have 48 hours to create an account and but any deal above 15 for the first time. If 48 hours runs out and they havent created an account then we cannot give you the credit.

        	<b style="font-size:13px;">How long is my account credit valid until?</b><br /> You have 3 months to use your credit. After the 3 months your unused credit will be no longer be valid to use.

        	<b style="font-size:13px;">How can I spend my credits?</b><br /> You can use your credit on any deal you want. You will have to redeem your credit on the payment page otherwise the credit will not be rewarded towards your deal price. If you have recommended us to many people then there may be situation where your account credit is more than the deal price so in this case, whatever is left over can be used on your deal unless it has expired.
